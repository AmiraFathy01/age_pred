Project Name: Age Prediction from Images
Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict a person's age range from an input image. Given a facial image, the system analyzes visual features and returns an estimated age range (e.g., 20-30, 30-40, etc.).

Key Features
Image Processing: Automatically detects and extracts faces from input images

Age Estimation: Predicts age range using deep learning models



Technology Stack
Python 3.9
TensorFlow/Keras 
OpenCV (for face detection)
Firebase (for database)
fastapi ( for api)
